# :spades: Simple Blackjack Command Line Game

## :page_facing_up: Overview

The Simple Blackjack Command Line Game is a Python-based command line interface code that simulates a game of blackjack. It follows the principles of object-oriented programming, providing an interactive and engaging gaming experience.

## :gear: Functionality

The command line game offers the following features:

- Player Interaction: Players can participate in a game of blackjack by making decisions, such as hitting (drawing a card) or standing (keeping their hand as is).
- Card Dealing: The game deals cards to the player and the dealer, following the standard rules of blackjack.
- Scoring and Evaluation: The game calculates the score for each player's hand and determines the winner based on predefined rules.
- Object-Oriented Design: The code is structured using classes and objects to organize the game logic and facilitate extensibility.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the blackjack game, focusing on the core mechanics and object-oriented programming principles. It does not include advanced features such as splitting or doubling down.

## :rocket: Opportunities for Improvement

While the Simple Blackjack Command Line Game provides an enjoyable gaming experience, there are several opportunities for enhancement:

- Game Refinement: Consider adding additional gameplay elements, such as more advanced card counting strategies or customizable rules.
- Error Handling: Improve error handling to provide informative messages when players input invalid actions or encounter unexpected situations.
- User Interface Enhancement: Explore options to enhance the command line interface with ASCII art or other visual elements.
